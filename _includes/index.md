Hi there! I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Didian](https://www.mydidian.com), a full stack real estate marketplace that connects agents to developers to sell new projects. We build software to make real estate transactions more transparent, delightful, and efficient for agents, buyers, and developers.

Prior to Didian, I was the first Product hire at [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com), where I spent close to 4 years shipping various Credit products to millions of under-banked, middle-class Americans to help them build credit and good financial habits. 

I graduated from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) in 2014 with a major in [Operations Research and Management Science](https://www.ieor.berkeley.edu).

I'm a big fan of data visualization 📊, the Golden State Warriors 🏀, Manchester United ⚽, swimming 🏊, and traveling ✈️.

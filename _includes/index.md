Hi there! I'm a recent graduate of the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu), where I studied [Operations Research & Management Science](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu). I currently work at [Ashoka's Catapult](http://www.catapultincubator.org/), an intensive five-month incubator program that aims to source and develop the world's most promising young entrepreneurs.  

I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but moved to the United States for college. I am now based in New York City. 

I am a big fan of data visualization, new technologies, Crossfit, and Manchester United.

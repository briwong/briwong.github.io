Hi there! I'm a recent graduate of the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu), where I studied [Operations Research & Management Science](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu). I currently work at the intersection of software and analytics as an engineer at [MoneyLion](http://www.moneylion.com). 

I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but moved to the US for college. I'm now based in New York City. 

I'm a big fan of data visualization, new technologies, Crossfit, and Manchester United.

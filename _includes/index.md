Hi there! I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Didian](https://www.mydidian.com), a full stack real estate marketplace that connects agents to developers to sell pre-launch projects. We build software to make real estate transactions more transparent, delightful, and efficient for all parties involved. 

Prior to Didian, I was the first Product hire at [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com), where I spent close to 4 years shipping various Credit products to millions of under-banked, middle-class Americans. 

I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but moved to the US for college. 

I'm a big fan of data visualization 📊, the Golden State Warriors 🏀, Manchester United ⚽, swimming 🏊, and traveling ✈️.
